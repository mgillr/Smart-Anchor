# Scope Document: Self-Correcting AI-Driven Anchor Framework

## Objective

To develop an autonomous system that ensures:

1. Self-correction of errors during the installation and setup of the Anchor framework.
2. Continuous resolution of compilation errors in the `lib.rs` file during the build process.
3. A looped process that records, resolves, and retries compilation until all errors are resolved or the same error persists more than 5 times, triggering a failure.

## Key Requirements

### Core Features

1. **Installation Troubleshooting**:
   - Ensure all dependencies for Anchor are installed.
   - If any errors occur during installation, the system:
     - Parses error logs.
     - Identifies the root cause.
     - Automatically resolves the error (e.g., installs missing dependencies).
     - Re-runs the installation process.

2. **Compilation Error Handling for `lib.rs`**:
   - If `anchor build` fails, the system:
     - Logs the error.
     - Matches the error against a predefined error resolution database.
     - Attempts to resolve the error by modifying the code or setup.
     - Re-compiles until all errors are resolved or the same error occurs more than 5 times.

3. **Kill List for Persistent Errors**:
   - Maintain a "kill list" for errors that:
     - Cannot be resolved after 5 attempts.
     - Logs these errors with detailed debugging information for manual intervention.

4. **Autonomy**:
   - The framework operates autonomously, requiring minimal user input.
   - Includes feedback loops to refine error resolution processes over time.

5. **Offline Compatibility**:
   - Ensure the AI engine can operate offline with embedded error resolution logic and lightweight AI models.

6. **Anchor Framework Customization**:
   - The entire system will be based on modifications and customizations of the Anchor framework source code to integrate AI-driven self-correction mechanisms.
