# System Architecture: Self-Correcting AI-Driven Anchor Framework

## Overview

The system architecture is designed to support the autonomous operation of the Anchor framework with AI-driven self-correction capabilities. The architecture includes components for installation troubleshooting, compilation error handling, and offline AI model integration.

## Components

1. **Installation Troubleshooting Module**
   - Handles dependency checks and error resolution during the installation process.

2. **Compilation Error Handling Module**
   - Manages error logging, resolution, and re-compilation processes for the `lib.rs` file.

3. **AI Engine**
   - Operates offline with embedded error resolution logic and lightweight AI models.

4. **Feedback Loop System**
   - Continuously refines error resolution processes based on past experiences and outcomes.

5. **Logging and Monitoring**
   - Captures detailed logs for installation and compilation processes, aiding in debugging and manual intervention when necessary.

## Data Flow

- **Error Detection**: Errors are detected during installation or compilation.
- **Error Logging**: Detected errors are logged for analysis.
- **Error Resolution**: The system attempts to resolve errors using predefined strategies and AI models.
- **Re-attempt**: The process is retried until successful or a persistent error is identified.

## Deployment

- The system is designed to be deployed in environments where the Anchor framework is used, with minimal user intervention required.

## Future Enhancements

- Integration with cloud-based AI services for enhanced error resolution capabilities.
- Expansion of the error resolution database with community-contributed solutions.
