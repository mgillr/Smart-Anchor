## Implementation Plan

1. **Documentation**: Finalize the scope and architecture documents.
2. **Installation Troubleshooting**: Develop scripts to automate dependency checks and error resolution.
3. **Compilation Error Handling**: Implement error logging and resolution mechanisms.
4. **Autonomy and Offline Compatibility**: Integrate AI models for offline error resolution.
5. **Testing and Refinement**: Test the system thoroughly and refine error resolution processes.
