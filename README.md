## **Features** ✨

- **🔍 Installation Assistance:** Detects and fixes missing dependencies or misconfigurations during setup.
- **🛠 Compilation Debugging:** Automatically resolves issues in `lib.rs` and related files during `cargo build` or `anchor build`.
- **♻️ Self-Correcting Build Loop:** Re-compiles until all errors are resolved or flagged for manual review.
- **💾 Offline-Ready-Debugging:** Functions without internet using a built-in error database and models.
- **📋 Developer-Friendly Logs:** Records unresolved issues with detailed debugging info.
